				<h1>Pressure Testing</h1>
				<p>
                    Pipeline integrity pressure testing is a critical procedure employed to assess the structural soundness and safety of pipelines across various industries. By subjecting the pipeline to controlled pressure, often with water or inert gases like nitrogen, this testing method detects weaknesses, leaks, and potential points of failure. Through meticulous monitoring and analysis of pressure changes, engineers can pinpoint vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry standards and regulations. This proactive approach to pipeline maintenance helps prevent catastrophic failures, safeguards the environment, and protects communities. With advanced technologies and rigorous testing protocols, pipeline integrity pressure testing ensures the reliability and longevity of vital infrastructure, promoting safety and confidence in our interconnected systems.</p>

				<h1>Hydrostatic Testing</h1>
				<p>Hydrostatic testing involves filling the pipeline with water and pressurizing it to a specified level, typically 1.5 times the maximum operating pressure, for a set duration. This test evaluates the pipeline's ability to withstand pressure and detects leaks or weaknesses. Since water is incompressible, any expansion or deformation of the pipeline can be more easily detected. Hydrostatic testing is generally considered safer because water is non-flammable and poses a lower risk of explosion compared to other testing mediums.</p>

                <p>
                    Choosing nitrogen testing over hydrostatic testing may be preferable for several reasons:</p><br><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>Nitrogen testing is suitable for pipelines prone to <strong>corrosion or degradation</strong>, eliminating the risk of damage associated with exposure to water during hydrostatic testing.</li>
                    <li>Nitrogen testing typically requires <strong>less time</strong> than hydrostatic testing, making it more <strong>efficient</strong> for projects with tight schedules or when minimizing downtime is crucial.</li>
                    <li>By avoiding the use of water, nitrogen testing minimizes <strong>environmental impact</strong>, reducing the potential for <strong>contamination or ecological harm</strong> in sensitive areas.</li>
                    <li>Nitrogen testing <strong>enhances safety</strong> by eliminating the need to handle large volumes of water, reducing the risk of accidents related to water handling, and nitrogen being non-flammable and non-toxic.</li>
                    <li>The inert nature of nitrogen allows for <strong>precise detection of smaller leaks</strong> without water interference, resulting in <strong>more accurate results</strong>, particularly in systems with intricate configurations.</li>

				<h1>Jetting</h1>
				<p>Nitrogen jetting is the use of high pressure gas to scour and remove the buildup of <strong>rust, dirt, sand, gravel, sludge, roots, scale, grease, and other debris.</strong> A nitrogen based fluid is pumped through a high pressure nozzle to create a high velocity stream which is used to clean out the well-bore, and flush out the debris.
